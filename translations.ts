Our goal is to provide tools and information to help you understand your finances better, plan for the future, and make confident financial decisions." },
                { q: "Q2: Is it free to use these calculators?", a: "A: Yes, all tools and resources on this site are 100% free. There are no hidden charges or subscriptions." },
                { q: "Q3: Do you save my financial data?", a: "A: No. Your privacy is very important to us. All calculations are done directly on your own device (in your web browser). We do not see, save, or have access to any of the personal financial information you enter." },
                { q: "Q4: Can I consider this financial advice?", a: "A: No. The calculators and information on this site are for educational and informational purposes only. They are a great starting point for planning, but they are not a substitute for professional advice from a qualified financial advisor who understands your personal situation." }

            questions: [
                { q: "Q5: Which currency is used in the calculators?", a: "A: All calculators primarily use the US Dollar ($) for calculations, as it is a common currency in Cambodian banking and finance. For converting between USD, KHR, and other regional currencies, please use our Currency Converter tool." },
                { q: "Q6: Why are the loan results here slightly different from my bank's quote?", a: "A: Our calculators use standard, universal formulas for financial calculations. Banks, however, may include additional fees (like processing or insurance fees) or use slightly different compounding methods. Always refer to the official documents from your bank for the most accurate figures." },
                { q: "Q7: Can I save or print my calculations?", a: "A: Yes! Many of our tools, including the Loan Calculator (for its amortization schedule) and the Monthly Budget Planner, have a \"Download\" or \"Print\" button that allows you to save a copy of your results for your personal records." }

            questions: [
                 { q: "Q8: What is the difference between a loan's Principal and the Interest?", a: "A: The Principal is the original amount of money you borrow. The Interest is the extra money you pay to the lender as a fee for borrowing the principal. Over the life of the loan, you pay back both. You can learn more in our Financial Glossary." },
                { q: "Q9: What is Compound Interest and why is it important for savings?", a: "A: Compound interest is \"interest earned on your interest.\" It means that as your savings grow, the amount of interest you earn also grows, causing your money to grow much faster over time. You can see its power in action with our Compound Interest Calculator." },
                { q: "Q10: What is a Debt-to-Income Ratio?", a: "A: This is the percentage of your monthly gross income that goes towards paying your monthly debt payments. Lenders use it to measure your ability to manage the payments you make every month to repay money you have borrowed. A lower ratio is generally better. See our Quick Financial Tips for a common rule of thumb." }
